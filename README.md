# Learning-ML-from-zero
My self-study evidence for machine learning from zero

I finished high school about six months ago and now I’m enjoying my gap year. After playing games and scrolling through TikTok for half a year each, I developed an interest in ML. So I plan to self-study ML until my uni begins.

I never really hit the books during my high school years, so there’s a lot of math in these materials—I can’t even understand how those formulae are derived without learning the relevant math first. XD

My materials include math fundamentals, principles of ML algorithms and some simple projects.

Thank my friends Doubao, ChatGPT, and Grok—they’ve helped me a lot!!! :)
